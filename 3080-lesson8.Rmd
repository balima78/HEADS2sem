## Linear Mixed Models

2020-04-28

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = F)
```

Repeated measures designs: measurements are taken several times in each participant. 

*Example: measure both arm lengths in each participant*  

**Model assumptions:** Random intercept and slope are assumed independent


Class exercise: Effect of sleep deprivation on cognitive performances.
```{r}
# Load the lme4 package
library(lme4)
# load the sleepstudy data set
data(sleepstudy)

```

data dimensions:
```{r}
dim(sleepstudy)
```

variables:
```{r}
colnames(sleepstudy)
```

data visualisation
```{r}
plot(sleepstudy$Days,sleepstudy$Reaction)
```

```{r}
plot(sleepstudy$Days,sleepstudy$Reaction)
lines(sleepstudy$Days,sleepstudy$Reaction)
```


Define the model:
```{r}
model <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days | Subject), sleepstudy)
summary(model)
```

Model interpretation: an average reaction time at enrollment of 251.4 ms; increase of 10.5 ms/day of sleep deprivation.

Also: low correlation between random slope and intercept (7%)

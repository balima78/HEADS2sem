# Preface {-}

This is a _book_ written in **Markdown** through *RStudio*.

The **bookdown** package [@xie2015] can be installed from CRAN or Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

In this _book_, I will try to compile all the homeworks from the 2nd semester 2019/2020 of **HEADS** PhD programme. 

An exhaustive explanation using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] can be found at <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/">bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown</a> and this is only a sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr**

This _book_ is publish through NETLIFY as described by <a href="https://cerebralmastication.com/2019/05/11/publishing-bookdown-to-netlify-automagically/">C.M.</a>

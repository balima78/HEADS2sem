**Exercise**

The “alcohol.sav” database contains information about alcoholic patients who have finished their hospital treatment.

Explore the predictors of the time elapsed from the release of alcohol treatment to
relapse.

Variables:

 - Weeks: the number of weeks until relapse or censoring
 
 - Event: 0-no relapse; 1-relapse
 
 - Group: group of treatment (0-detox only; 1-detox plus therapy)
 
 - Symptoms: level of psychological distress (ranging from 1-lowest to 5-highest)
 
 - AA: attending of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings (0-no; 1-yes)

*all code from the professor*

Open the file in spss.
```{r}
library(foreign)
data <- read.spss(file="2.UploadedData/Alcohol.sav", use.missing=TRUE) 
data
```

Create the survival object
```{r}
# load packages
library(splines)
library(survival)
Surv(data$weeks, data$Event)
```

obtain the median of survival.
```{r}
# produce the Kaplan-Meier curves and estimates.
KM1 <- survfit(Surv(data$weeks, data$Event)~1)
KM1
```

obtain the survival in several points of time.
```{r}
summary(KM1)
```

Plot survival curve with confidence intervals
```{r}
plot(KM1, mark.time=F)
```

produce the Kaplan-Meier curves and estimates according one factor (group of treatment)
```{r}
KM_group <- survfit(Surv(data$weeks, data$Event)~1+data$Group)
# To obtain the median of survival according one factor (group of treatment).
KM_group
``` 

obtain the survival in several points of time according one factor (group of treatment).
```{r}
summary(KM_group)
```

Plot survival curve with confidence intervals according one factor (group of treatment)
```{r}
plot(KM_group,col=c("red", "blue"),mark.time=F,ylim=c(0,1),xlab="time",ylab="S")
legend("topright", title="Group", legend=c( "Detox" , "Treatment"), col=c("red" , "blue"), lty=1:1, cex=0.8)

```

Log-rank test
```{r}
survdiff(Surv(data$weeks, data$Event)~1+data$Group, rho=0)
```

CONCLUSION FROM LOG-RANK TEST: there is not a significant difference in the time until relapse between groups (p=0.1)

Unadjusted cox regression.
```{r}
coxuni <- coxph(Surv(data$weeks, data$Event)~1+as.factor(data$Group))
summary(coxuni)
```

CONCLUSION FROM Unadjusted cox regression: The conclusion from log-rank test is very similar to the conclusion from Log-Rank test. However, with this aproach (Cox regression), we can adjust for other variables.

Multivariated cox regression.
```{r}
coxadjust <- coxph(Surv(data$weeks, data$Event)~1+as.factor(data$Group)+data$symptoms+as.factor(data$AA))
summary(coxadjust)
```

When adjusted form level of psychological distress (symptoms) and attending AA there is a significant difference in the time until relapse between groups (p=0.018)

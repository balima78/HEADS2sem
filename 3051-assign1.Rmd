```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = F)
```

The file `cancer.csv` contains data of 1207 women who were diagnosed with breast cancer [event: death -> variable: `status`].

```{r}
#Load the library required for a survival analysis
library(splines)
library(survival)
#Read data
data<-read.csv("2.UploadedData/cancer.csv",sep=";",dec=",")
```

Variables included in the dataset:
```{r}
str(data)
```

a) Produce a Kaplan-Meier curve for the data presented in the file.

Kaplan-Meier survival curve
```{r}
km<-survfit(Surv(data$time,data$status)~1)

km
```

Plot survival curve with confidence intervals
```{r}
plot(km, mark.time = F)
abline(h = 0.5)
```

b) Obtain a Kaplan-Meier curve, separating women according to the variable `ln_yesno` (Lymph nodes) and test whether the survival of the two groups is significantly different (Log-rank test).

Kaplan-Meier survival according to Lymph nodes: 
```{r}
km.ln<-survfit(Surv(data$time,data$status) ~ data$ln_yesno)

km.ln
```

Plot survival curve according to Lymph nodes:
```{r}
plot(km.ln, col = c("red", "blue"), mark.time = F,
     ylim=c(0,1), xlab="time", ylab = "Survival")
legend("topright", title="Lymph nodes", legend=c("No","Yes"),
       col=c("red","blue"), lty=1:1, cex=0.8)
```

**Log-rank test**

H0: No difference between the groups.
```{r}
survdiff(Surv(data$time, data$status) ~ data$ln_yesno, rho = 0)
```

HEADS 2nd semester 2019/2020

Compilation of HEADS homeworks for the 2nd semester 2019/2020 in the branch HIDA. I will try to do weekly updates with homeworks and eventualy one or another resume.


This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). Please see the page "Get Started" at https://bookdown.org/ for how to compile this example.

The result of this book is available from here: https://heads2sem.netlify.app/

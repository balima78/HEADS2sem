### Diet (diet.sav)

- To evaluate weight loss diets, a sample of 60 overweight individuals was collected. 

- The subjects were weighed before the diet (time = 0), three months after the begining (time = 1) and six months after the begining (time = 2) 

- The subjects were randomized in two group (diet=1 and diet=2). The two groups had diferente diet plans.

Read data
```{r}
library(foreign)
data1 <- read.spss(file="2.UploadedData/diet.sav", use.missing=TRUE)
data1<-as.data.frame(data1)

# factorize variables
data1$subject<-as.factor(data1$subject)
data1$diet<-as.factor(data1$diet)

str(data1)
```

Was there a significant weight loss in this sample of 60 subjects?

Fit a Linear Mixed Model
```{r}
library(afex)
modeld<-lmer(weigth ~ time + (time|subject) , data1)

summary(modeld)
```

Was there a significant difference between diets?

What is the best diet?
```{r}
modeldt<-lmer(weigth ~ diet + time + (time|subject) , data1)

summary(modeldt)
```

### Child development (dev3yrheads.sav)

In a study on risk factors that affect child development, 1145 children were followed up to the third year of life.

- At the age of three, a test was performed to assess the child's psycho-motor development, resulting in a global development score (DEVSCORE).

- The dev3yr.sav database contains part of the information collected in the study.

Read data
```{r}
data2 <- read.spss(file="2.UploadedData/Dev3yrheads.sav", use.missing=TRUE)

data2<-as.data.frame(data2)

str(data2)
```

Is the type of residence (urban, rural or degraded) a risk factor for psycho-motor development at the
age of three when adjusted for the mother's age (mage) and for neurological neonatal Score (score)?

Fit a linear model
```{r}
model1<-lm(devscore ~ mage + resid + score, data = data2)

library(broom)
tidy(model1)

glance(model1)
```

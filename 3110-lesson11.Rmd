```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = F, message = F)
```

1. We want to know if the number of awards earned by students at one high school is associated to the type of program in which the student was enrolled (prog: 1=vocational, 2=general, 3=academic) and the score on their final exam in math (math).

Read the data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
sim <- read_csv("2.UploadedData/sim.csv")

summary(sim)
```

table outcome
```{r}
table(sim$num_awards)

sim<-sim %>% mutate(prog = factor(prog))
```

fit a poisson regression
```{r}
poisson <- glm(num_awards ~ prog + math, data =
                 sim, family = "poisson")

summary(poisson)
```

compute relative risks (RR)
```{r}
exp(cbind(RR = coef(poisson), confint(poisson)))
```

histogram for the outcome
```{r}
hist(sim$num_awards)
```

due to the excess of zerosit would be advise to consider a ZERO-INFLATED POISSON REGRESSION

2. A researcher is interested in how variables, such as GRE (Graduate Record Exam scores), GPA (grade point average) and prestige of the undergraduate institution, effect admission into graduate school.
```{r}
school <- read_csv("2.UploadedData/school.csv")

summary(school)
```

fit a logistic regression model
```{r}
logistic <- glm(admit ~ gre + gpa + rank, data = school, family = "binomial")
summary(logistic)
```

compute OR and 95%CI
```{r}
exp(cbind(OR = coef(logistic), confint(logistic)))
```

Predict the probability (p) of admission
```{r}
probabilities <- predict(logistic, type = "response")
```

add a column with the logit values
```{r}
school <- school %>%
  mutate(logit = log(probabilities/(1-probabilities))) 
```

plot linearity between logit and predictive variables
```{r}
ggplot(school, aes(logit, gpa)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
ggplot(school, aes(logit, gre)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
ggplot(school, aes(logit, rank)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

test models' goodness of fit
```{r}
library(ResourceSelection)
hoslem.test(school$admit, fitted(logistic))
```
as the p-value is higher than 0.05 we do not reject H0: good fit of the model to the data.

ROC - AUC
```{r}
library(pROC)
plot.roc(school$admit, fitted(logistic))
```

Confusion matrix
```{r}
library(caret)
confusionMatrix(factor(school$admit), factor(ifelse(probabilities<0.5,0,1)))
```

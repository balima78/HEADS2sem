ROSE;Random Over-Sampling Examples;The package provides functions to deal with binary classification problems in the presence of imbalanced classes. Synthetic balanced samples are generated according to ROSE (Menardi and Torelli, 2013). Functions that implement more traditional remedies to the class imbalance are also provided, as well as different metrics to evaluate a learner accuracy. These are estimated by holdout, bootstrap or cross-validation methods.
themis;Extra Recipes Steps for Dealing with Unbalanced Data;A dataset with an uneven number of cases in each class is said to be unbalanced. Many models produce a subpar performance on unbalanced datasets. A dataset can be balanced by increasing the number of minority cases using SMOTE 2011 <arXiv:1106.1813>, BorderlineSMOTE 2005 <doi:10.1007/11538059_91> and ADASYN 2008 <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4633969>. Or by decreasing the number of majority cases using NearMiss 2003 <https://www.site.uottawa.ca/~nat/Workshop2003/jzhang.pdf> or Tomek link removal 1976 <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4309452>.
imbalance;Preprocessing Algorithms for Imbalanced Datasets;"Class imbalance usually damages the performance of classifiers. Thus, it is important to treat data before applying a classifier algorithm. This package includes recent resampling algorithms in the literature: (Barua et al. 2014) <doi:10.1109/tkde.2012.232>; (Das et al. 2015) <doi:10.1109/tkde.2014.2324567>, (Zhang et al. 2014) <doi:10.1016/j.inffus.2013.12.003>; (Gao et al. 2014) <doi:10.1016/j.neucom.2014.02.006>; (Almogahed et al. 2014) <doi:10.1007/s00500-014-1484-5>. It also includes an useful interface to perform oversampling."
smotefamily;A Collection of Oversampling Techniques for Class Imbalance Problem Based on SMOTE;A collection of various oversampling techniques developed from SMOTE is provided. SMOTE is a oversampling technique which synthesizes a new minority instance between a pair of one minority instance and one of its K nearest neighbor. (see <https://www.jair.org/media/953/live-953-2037-jair.pdf> for more information) Other techniques adopt this concept with other criteria in order to generate balanced dataset for class imbalance problem
ebmc;Ensemble-Based Methods for Class Imbalance Problem;Four ensemble-based methods (SMOTEBoost, RUSBoost, UnderBagging, and SMOTEBagging) for class imbalance problem are implemented for binary classification. Such methods adopt ensemble methods and data re-sampling techniques to improve model performance in presence of class imbalance problem. One special feature offers the possibility to choose multiple supervised learning algorithms to build weak learners within ensemble models. References: Nitesh V.

unbalanced;Racing for Unbalanced Methods Selection;A dataset is said to be unbalanced when the class of interest (minority class) is much rarer than normal behaviour (majority class). The cost of missing a minority class is typically much higher that missing a majority class. Most learning systems are not prepared to cope with unbalanced data and several techniques have been proposed. This package implements some of most well-known techniques and propose a racing algorithm to select adaptively the most appropriate strategy for a given unbalanced task.
ebal;Entropy reweighting to create balanced samples;Package implements entropy balancing, a data preprocessing procedure that allows users to reweight a dataset such that the covariate distributions in the reweighted data satisfy a set of user specified moment conditions. This can be useful to create balanced samples in observational studies with a binary treatment where the control group data can be reweighted to match the covariate moments in the treatment group. Entropy balancing can also be used to reweight a survey sample to known characteristics from a target population.
IRIC;Integrated R Library for Imbalanced Classification;IRIC is an R library for imbalanced classification, which will bring convenience to users by integrating a wide set of solutions into one library.
caret;Classification and Regression Training;Misc functions for training and plotting classification and regression models.
mlr3;Machine Learning in R - Next Generation;Efficient, object-oriented programming on the building blocks of machine learning. Provides 'R6' objects for tasks, learners, resamplings, and measures. The package is geared towards scalability and larger datasets by supporting parallelization and out-of-memory data-backends like databases. While 'mlr3' focuses on the core computational operations, add-on packages provide additional functionality.
